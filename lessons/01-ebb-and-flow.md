# Ebb & Flow

> The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility. But first, we must ‘accept the ebb and flow of things.’

  - Illustrate on paper and [redraw or draw in Illustrator](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-classic-vector-painting-with-watercolor-washes-and-line-art--vector-1481) or Sketch, not in Photoshop `#vector`
  - If illustrated on paper, scan in or capture as a photo reference to place into Illustrator or Sketch and redraw as vector art
  - First, solve the illustration; second, fuss over the visual style
- [ ] Provide an “About the Author” section with a brief bio and headshot photo `#selfie`
- [ ] Provide a “Read Full Article” link at the end of the summary
- [ ] Use of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to show the hierarchy and structure of the content, such as headings and subheadings, and paragraphs and lists

### Style as an Enhancement

- [ ] Use of meaningful CSS class selector names
- [ ] Author and apply styles for mobile first
