## Brief

Design a modern day type specimen website, promoting a not so “modern”, but influential typeface that defined the early days of the web and continues to do so in today's web.

Select a web safe font; show off its styles and weights: italic, normal, and bold; transform its cases: upper, lower, and even small-caps; change its size: 1em to 10em, smaller to larger; and even a swash such as a drop capital or an ornamental character such as an ampersand.

Consider both typographic color: style, weight, size, and spacing, before foreground and background color; let the type talk first, then enhance by layering on a conversation of color to better communicate an aesthetic or emotion.
